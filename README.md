# Room Editor

A simple application for designing a room. It is highly inspired by Animal Crossing and its way of designing the rooms in your house.

The room is grid-based in a square of 8x8 witch can be customizable with furniture with the sizes of 1x1, 2x1 and 2x2.

Right now, the project is in barebones. This is just a concept and a way for me to learn and get better with React and Three js
