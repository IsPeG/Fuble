# Room Editor

A simple application for designing a room. It is highly inspired by Animal Crossing and the way of designing the rooms of your house in the game.

The room is a grid-based square of 8x8 with 2 subdivisions in each cell. It can be customizable with furniture with the sizes of 1x1, 2x1 and 2x2.

Each furniture have its own properties witch make them have special funcionality: Some can have other pieces on top or can have lights witch can be toggled on or off, for example.

Right now, the project is in barebones. This is just a concept and a way for me to learn and get better with React and Three js
