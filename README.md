# Room Editor

A simple application for designing a room. It is highly inspired by Animal Crossing and its way of designing the rooms in your house.

The room is a grid-based square of 8x8 with 2 subdivisions in each cell. It can be customizable with furniture with the sizes of 1x1, 2x1 and 2x2.

Each furniture have its own properties such as surface, so it can have other pieces on top, or light, so it can have lights witch can be toggled on or off.

Right now, the project is in barebones. This is just a concept and a way for me to learn and get better with React and Three js
